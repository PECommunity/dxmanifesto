Happy developers are necessary for creating exceptional software.
By building software and helping others to do the same, we have come to value:

- Automation of repetitive tasks over manual grind
- Convention in tooling over tooling configuration
- Sustainable development pace over constant crunch time
- Adopting best practices over status quo

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
