The creation of exceptional software solutions will firstly require satisfied developers. Through our own journey of building software and helping others to achieve the same goal, we have concluded that the following 4 principles should lie at the core of the Developer Experience:

- **Automate** the repetitive tasks
- **Conventionalise** the workflow through tooling
- **Sustain** the development pace consistently
- **Adopt** the industry wide best practices

We do not deny the value of other principles, however, we have come to value the above mentioned points with a significantly stronger emphasis.
